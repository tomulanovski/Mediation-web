    question: "How long does mediation typically take?",
    answer: "Most cases are resolved in 1 session. Complex cases may require additional sessions, but mediation is still significantly faster than litigation."
  },
  {
    question: "Is what we discuss in mediation confidential?",
    answer: "Yes. Everything discussed in mediation is strictly confidential and cannot be used in court if mediation is unsuccessful. This allows both parties to speak openly."
  },
  {
    question: "Do I need an attorney for mediation?",
    answer: "Attorneys aren't required to participate in mediation, and many clients come without one. That said, you're welcome to bring your attorney if you'd like. Having any final agreement reviewed by legal counsel before signing is always a good idea."
  },
  {
    question: "What if we can't reach an agreement?",
    answer: "While reaching a full agreement is always the goal, it isn't always possible. If some issues remain unresolved, you still have options. Many families use mediation to settle what they can in mediation and turn to the courts only for what they can't."
  },
  {
    question: "How much does mediation cost compared to litigation?",
    answer: "Mediation costs a fraction of traditional litigation. While fees vary based on the duration of mediation, most families save significantly in both time and money compared to going through the court system."
  },
  {
    question: "Can mediation work if my spouse and I aren't communicating well?",
    answer: "Absolutely. In fact, that's one of the primary reasons people choose mediation. Our mediators are trained to facilitate productive communication, even when emotions are running high. In sessions, we often will separate parties into different meeting rooms, allowing each person to communicate openly without the added tension of being face to face."
  },
  {
    question: "Do both parties need to agree to mediation?",
    answer: "Generally, yes. Mediation works best when both parties are willing to engage, though it can also be court-ordered. In either case, many reluctant participants find the process more comfortable and constructive than they anticipated."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the mediation agreement legally binding?",
    answer: "Once both parties sign the mediated agreement and it is submitted to and approved by the court, it becomes a legally binding court order. We both parties are welcome to have their agreement reviewed by independent attorneys before signing."
